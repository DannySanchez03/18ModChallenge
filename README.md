## Description

In this Module 18 Challenge we were told to use mongoDb or mongoose and express to make a app that can create a user and allow them to share thoughts to anyone and allow anyone to react to those thoughts and add and remove friends, we were told to check its functionality using insomnia to test all the routes correctly and recieve the format back correctly

By the way I pasted my brother's ID twice in the Delete request for removing friends, I tested it and it works as its supposed too, I just didnt notice that I got his ID's twice.
